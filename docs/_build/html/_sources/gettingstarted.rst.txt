    :alt: Input directory structure

The directory structure should be like this and the input files from each station should be stored inside these station directories.

Run the program executing **python3 main.py** in the command line.
The output files will be stored in the **data** folder (if it doesn't exists, it will be created)
These files in the data folder contain the decoded data from all the frames.
The console output gives shows the frames occuring thrice or more in different station files.
